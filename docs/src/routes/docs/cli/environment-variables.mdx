# Environment Variables

Tombi CLI supports several environment variables to configure its behavior.

## TOMBI_OFFLINE

Disable network access and use only local schema cache.

When set, Tombi will not fetch schemas from remote sources and will only use cached schemas locally. This is useful when working in offline environments or when you want to ensure no network requests are made.

- Type: `true | false`
- Default: `false`

## TOMBI_NO_CACHE

Disable cache usage and fetch the latest data from remote sources.

When set, Tombi will bypass the cache and fetch the latest schemas from remote sources, then save them to the cache. This is useful when you want to ensure you have the most up-to-date schema data.

- Type: `true | false`
- Default: `false`

## TOMBI_CACHE_TTL

Set the cache expiration time (Time To Live) in seconds for JSON Catalog/Schemas.

When set, Tombi will use this value as the cache expiration time instead of the default 24 hours. Cached schemas older than this duration will be automatically refreshed from remote sources.

- Type: `Integer` (seconds)
- Default: `86400` (24 hours)

## TOMBI_HTTP_TIMEOUT

Set the HTTP timeout in seconds for fetching remote schemas.

This environment variable controls how long Tombi will wait for HTTP requests to complete before timing out. If `TOMBI_HTTP_TIMEOUT` is not set, Tombi will fall back to `HTTP_TIMEOUT` if available.

- Type: `Integer` (seconds)
- Default: `5`
