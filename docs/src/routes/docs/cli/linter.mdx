# Linter CLI Usage

Tombi's linter can be run via the CLI.

```bash
# If you have `tombi.toml` in your project, Lint all TOML files in the project,
# if not, it will lint all TOML files in the current directory
tombi lint

# Lint a single file
tombi lint path/to/file.toml

# Lint multiple files
tombi lint path/to/file1.toml path/to/file2.toml

# Lint all TOML files in a directory
tombi lint .

# Lint files using glob pattern
tombi lint **/*.toml

# Lint from standard input
cat Cargo.toml | tombi lint -
```


<Note>
If only warnings are found during linting, Tombi will exit successfully by default.  
However, you can use the `--error-on-warnings` option to make Tombi exit with an error when warnings are present.
