# Comment Directive

Tombi supports comment directives to control the behavior of the document.

There are two types of comment directories with different scopes of application, as follows.

| Type | Directive | Scope |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Document Comment Directive | `#:tombi` | Document |
| Value Comment Directive | `# tombi:` | Value |

## Document Comment Directive

Document comment directives are comments that apply to the entire document.

This only works in the comment group at the beginning of the document, so you need to add a blank line before the document value.

### `#:schema`

`#:schema` is used to specify the schema to use for the document.

```toml
#:schema tombi://json.schemastore.org/pyproject.json

[project]
name = "tombi"
```

### `#:tombi`

`#:tombi` adds instructions to Tombi. The instructions can be written in the TOML syntax, and can specify the TOML version information, etc.

The following instructions are currently available.

```toml
#:tombi toml-version = "v1.0.0"
#:tombi format.disable = true
#:tombi lint.disable = true
#:tombi schema.strict = false
```

## (Draft) Value Comment Directive

<Warning>
This feature is not yet implemented and will be implemented in the future.
</Warning>

Value comment directives are comments that apply to a specific value. 

```toml
# tombi: lint.rules.key-empty = "off"
"" = "value"
```
