# Comment Directive

Tombi supports comment directives to control the behavior of the document.

There are two types of comment directives with different scopes of application:

| Type | Directive | Scope |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Document Comment Directive | `#:schema`, `#:tombi` | Document |
| Value Comment Directive | `# tombi:` | Value |

### Document Comment Directive

Document comment directives are comments that apply to the entire document. These only work in the comment group at the beginning of the document.

- **[#:schema](/docs/comment-directive/schema-document-directive)** - Specify JSON Schema for validation
- **[#:tombi](/docs/comment-directive/tombi-document-directive)** - Document-level configuration (TOML version, format/lint/schema options)

### Value Comment Directive

Value comment directives are comments that apply to a specific value, allowing fine-grained control over formatting and linting rules.

- **[# tombi:](/docs/comment-directive/tombi-value-directive)** - Value-level configuration (format rules, lint rules)
