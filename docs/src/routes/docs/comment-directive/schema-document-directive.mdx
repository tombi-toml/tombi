# `#:schema` Document Directive

Same as [Taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/directives.html#the-schema-directive), `#:schema` is used to specify the schema to use for the document.
However, Tombi only allows document comment directives at the beginning of the document, so you need to add a blank line after the directive.

## Usage

```toml
#:schema tombi://json.schemastore.org/pyproject.json

[project]
name = "tombi"
```

The `#:schema` directive must be:
- Placed at the beginning of the document
- Followed by a blank line before any TOML content
- Written in a comment group (consecutive comment lines)

## Schema URIs

You can use various schema URIs:

### HTTP/HTTPS URLs

Reference schemas from remote URLs:

```toml
#:schema https://example.com/my-schema.json

[config]
value = "example"
```

### Local File Paths

Reference local schema files:

```toml
#:schema ./schemas/my-schema.json

[settings]
enabled = true
```
