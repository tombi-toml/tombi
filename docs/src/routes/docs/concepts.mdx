# Concepts

Tombi's concept is to allow any team or project to work on a TOML file with the same rules from the beginning.

## 🚀 Zero Configuration

Tombi's formatter is inspired by Python's black formatter philosophy - it has no configuration options.  
Not even line length is configurable.

Let's stop discussing the formatting rules on your team.

## 🛤️ Schema Driven

TOML is used in multiple programming languages and tools, so it needs to be formatted according to their rules.  
Don't worry! You don't need to specify the rules,
Tombi will automatically apply the rules by getting the schema from the [JSON Schema Store](https://json.schemastore.org).

Those rules are determined by the schema provider, not your team.  
Just like new programming languages come with formatters from the beginning, the schema provider determines those rules as well.

## ↕️ Auto Sorting

Tombi automatically sorts keys in your TOML files based on the JSON Schema definition.  
Using `x-tombi-*` extension properties in JSON Schema, schema providers can define the optimal key order.

This ensures consistency across your configuration files without manual intervention.  
Enjoy consistent formatting for your TOML files across all projects—much more valuable than just avoiding merge conflicts!
