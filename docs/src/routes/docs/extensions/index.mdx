# Extensions

<Warning>
The following features are experimental and may change in the future.
</Warning>

Tombi may support extensions in the future to provide better editor experiences for configuration files of specific systems (E.g. `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`).

Features that could be enhanced by system-specific extensions include:
- Go to definition/declaration
- Hover
- Completion

However, since developing extensions and designing APIs takes time, we will experimentally support some extension-like features built into the core.
