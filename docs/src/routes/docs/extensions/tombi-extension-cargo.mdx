# tombi-extension-cargo

Tombi is written in Rust, and we want to make the Rust development experience even better ðŸ¦€

Experimentally, we provide additional features when editing `Cargo.toml` files.

## Supported Features

### Code Completion

The extension provides intelligent code completion for `Cargo.toml` files.

#### Crate Version Completion

Get version suggestions when specifying crate versions:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0.130"  # <- version suggestions appear here
tokio = { version = "1.21.0" }  # <- also here
```

Features:
- Fetches available versions from crates.io
- Shows up to 100 versions sorted newest first
- Works in all dependency sections (`dependencies`, `dev-dependencies`, `build-dependencies`, `workspace.dependencies`)

#### Crate Feature Completion

Get feature suggestions when specifying crate features:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }  # <- feature suggestions
tokio = { version = "1.21", features = ["full", "net"] }  # <- in array
```

Features:
- Fetches available features from:
  - crates.io for registry dependencies
  - Local `Cargo.toml` for path dependencies
  - Workspace `Cargo.toml` for workspace dependencies
- Shows feature dependencies in documentation
- Filters out already selected features
- `default` feature shown first, features starting with `_` shown last

<Note>
The extension is context-aware: when a dependency uses `workspace = true`, it looks up features from the workspace definition.
</Note>

### Go to Definition
For example, suppose you have a `Cargo.toml` like the one below:

#### Go to workspace/crate definition from `dependencies`
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
tombi-ast = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Definition" will navigate you to the **workspace** definition or to the **crate** definition managed by the workspace.

In the example above, for `serde` (an external crate), you'll be navigated to the **workspace** definition, while for `tombi-ast` (a crate managed by the workspace), you'll be navigated to the **crate** definition.

<Note>
If you consistently want to navigate to the **workspace**'s `Cargo.toml`, use "Go to Declaration".
</Note> 

#### Go to crate definition from `workspace.dependencies`
```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
tombi-ast = { path = "crates/tombi-ast" }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `path`, executing "Go to Definition" will navigate you to the crate definition.

### Go to Declaration
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
tombi-ast = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Declaration" will navigate you to the crate definition.

### Code Actions

When working with `Cargo.toml` files, additional code actions are available.

#### Inherit from Workspace

Convert package fields to inherit from workspace configuration:

```toml
# Before
[package]
version = "1.0.0"
authors = ["John Doe"]

# After applying "Inherit from workspace"
[package]
version.workspace = true
authors.workspace = true
```

#### Inherit Dependency from Workspace

Convert dependencies to use workspace versions:

```toml
# Before
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"

# After applying "Inherit dependency from workspace"
[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
```

#### Convert Dependency to Table Format

Transform simple string dependencies to table format for adding additional fields:

```toml
# Before
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"

# After applying "Convert to table format"
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0" }
```

#### Add to Workspace and Inherit Dependency

Promote versioned dependencies into the workspace while switching members to use the shared entry:

```toml
# Before
# Workspace Cargo.toml
[workspace.dependencies]
# (serde not present)

# Member Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"

# After applying "Add to Workspace and Inherit Dependency"
[workspace.dependencies]
serde = "1.0"

[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
```

The workspace entry keeps the original requirement, and the member now follows the workspace-managed version.

### Document Links

The extension enriches `Cargo.toml` with contextual document links so you can jump directly to related resources:
- Entries in `[workspace.members]` and `[workspace.default-members]` open the corresponding member crate's `Cargo.toml`.
- Dependencies in member manifests surface links to the workspace definition (when `workspace = true`), local path manifests, git repositories, custom registries, or crates.io when applicable.
- `[workspace.dependencies]` entries provide quick access both to the workspace declaration and the external source (registry/git/crates.io).
- Fields such as `package.workspace`, `lints.workspace`, and `[bin]` targets link back to their workspace counterparts or the referenced source file for faster navigation.
