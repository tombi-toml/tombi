# tombi-extension-uv

Tombi provides enhanced features for Python projects using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), making Python development experience even better üêç

Experimentally, we provide additional features when editing `pyproject.toml` files.

<Warning>
Since uv is a third-party library and is provided by Tombi at its arbitrary discretion,
please use it as an experimental feature with the understanding that support may be discontinued in the future.
</Warning>

## Supported Features

### Go to Definition
For example, suppose you have a `pyproject.toml` like the one below:

#### Go to package definition from `dependencies`

```toml
[project]
name = "albatross"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["bird-feeder", "tqdm>=4,<5"]

[tool.uv.sources]
bird-feeder = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Definition" will navigate you to the the **package**'s `pyproject.toml` managed by the workspace.

<Note>
If you consistently want to navigate to the **workspace**'s `pyproject.toml` where the workspace is defined, use "Go to Declaration".
</Note>

### Go to Declaration
```toml
[project]
name = "albatross"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = ["bird-feeder", "tqdm>=4,<5"]

[tool.uv.sources]
bird-feeder = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Declaration" will navigate you to the workspace definition in the **workspace**'s `pyproject.toml` file.

`Go to Declaration` also works when the cursor is placed on the dependency string itself (e.g.: `"bird-feeder"`).  
If the package comes from `tool.uv.sources` with `workspace = true`, the command jumps to the member entry in the workspace `pyproject.toml`, letting you inspect which pattern pulled the project into the workspace.

### Code Actions

When editing member `pyproject.toml` files, additional refactor actions help you converge on workspace-managed dependencies.

#### Use Workspace Dependency

If the workspace already pins the dependency, select "Use Workspace Dependency" to strip the version requirement (and keep extras) so the member follows the workspace definition:

```toml
# Before
[project]
dependencies = ["pydantic>=2.10,<3.0"]

# After applying "Use Workspace Dependency"
[project]
dependencies = ["pydantic"]
```

The action also works inside `[project.optional-dependencies.*]` groups.

#### Add to Workspace and Use Workspace Dependency

When the workspace has not registered the dependency yet, this action adds the current versioned requirement to the workspace's `[project.dependencies]` array and rewrites the member entry to use the shared dependency:

```toml
# Before
# Workspace pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = []

# Member pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = ["pydantic>=2.10,<3.0"]

# After applying "Add to Workspace and Use Workspace Dependency"
[project]
dependencies = ["pydantic>=2.10,<3.0"]

# Member pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = ["pydantic"]
```

### Document Links

The extension annotates key uv metadata with document links so you can jump to the right file or website in one click:
- Entries in `[tool.uv.workspace.members]` (and matches found via globs) open the associated member project's `pyproject.toml`.
- Sources declared under `[tool.uv.sources]` with `workspace = true` expose links to both the member manifest and the workspace root configuration.
- Dependency arrays in `[project.dependencies]`, `[project.optional-dependencies.*]`, and `[dependency-groups.*]` link to local workspace packages when available, or fall back to the package page on PyPI.
