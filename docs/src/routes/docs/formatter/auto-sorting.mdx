# Auto Sorting

One of Tombi's most distinctive features is automatic sorting.
It can automatically sort content including comments, using its [own unique treatment of comments](/docs/formatter/treatment-of-comments).

## How to Specify Auto-Sorting Methods

Tombi does not perform automatic sorting unless a sorting method is specified.

Auto-sorting methods are available in the following order of priority:

- [Comment Directives](/docs/formatter/auto-sorting#comment-directives)
- [JSON Schema](/docs/formatter/auto-sorting#json-schema)

### Comment Directives

You can specify auto-sorting methods using [comment directives](/docs/comment-directive/tombi-value-directive#format-rules).
This has higher priority than [JSON Schema](/docs/json-schema#formatting) specifications.

<Warning>
This is intended for projects that are not large enough to warrant creating a JSON Schema,
or as a temporary workaround for errors in JSON Schemas registered in the Schema Store.
</Warning>

### JSON Schema
This is probably the method you'll benefit from the most.

When schemas automatically retrieved from the [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org) contain the following keys, automatic sorting is performed according to that schema:

- [x-tombi-table-keys-order](/docs/json-schema#x-tombi-table-keys-order) 
- [x-tombi-array-values-order](/docs/json-schema#x-tombi-array-values-order)
- [x-tombi-array-values-order-by](/docs/json-schema#x-tombi-array-values-order-by)

Files like `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml` registered in the JSON Schema Store have these keys specified.

Additionally, you can specify JSON Schema files using [configuration files](/docs/configuration) or [comment directives](/docs/comment-directive#format-rules), allowing you to apply schemas from sources other than the JSON Schema Store.
