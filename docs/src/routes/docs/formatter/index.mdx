# Formatter Overview

Tombi's formatter ensures consistent styling of your TOML files by automatically applying formatting rules.

Tombi is an uncompromising code formatter inspired by [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
The current policy is more strict, and there is no line-width specification. The default line width is 80 characters.

Furthermore, it features automatic sorting via JSON Schema metadata to maintain consistent order across all projects.
