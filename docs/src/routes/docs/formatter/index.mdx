# Formatter

Tombi's formatter ensures consistent styling of your TOML files by automatically applying formatting rules.

Tombi has a formatter function inspired by [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and features such as Magic Trailing Comma,
and it has [several options](/docs/configuration#available-options) for adjusting the formatting of its output like `line-width`, `indent-style`, and more.

Furthermore, it features automatic sorting via JSON Schema metadata to maintain consistent order across all projects.
