# JSON Schema

While TOML itself may introduce [schema specifications](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/792) in the future,
Tombi, like Taplo, is implementing validation features in its linter that support [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Currently, we are extending JSON Schema with special annotations using the `x-tombi-*` prefix.

## Schema Priority
This section explains how Tombi prioritizes the application of `x-tombi-*` keys in your JSON Schema:

1. `#:schema` directive in the TOML file's top comment (compatible with [Taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/directives.html#the-schema-directive))
2. JSON Schema specified in [the Tombi configuration file](/docs/configuration#search-priority)
3. JSON Schema from the [JSON Schema Store](https://json.schemastore.org)

## Formatting
### x-tombi-toml-version
This key automatically determines the TOML version to use.
Currently, we support:
- `v1.0.0` (stable)
- `v1.1.0-preview` (experimental)

The preview version includes exciting features like trailing comma support in Inline Tables.

<Note>
Until `v1.1.0` is officially released, we recommend using `v1.0.0`.

For experimental purposes, the JSON Schema in `tombi.toml` is specified as `v1.1.0-preview`.
</Note>

### x-tombi-table-keys-order

This key controls the automatic sorting of table keys (e.g., `[dependencies]`).

Available sorting strategies:
- `ascending`
- `descending`
- `version-sort`
- `schema`

<Note>
When using the `schema` strategy, we recommend avoiding `additionalProperties` or `patternProperties` as they are not sorted with `properties` and will appear at the end.
</Note>

<Note>
The `version-sort` strategy is based on the [Rust style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/#sorting).
</Note>

### x-tombi-array-values-order

This key controls the automatic sorting of array values.

Available sorting strategies:
- `ascending`
- `descending`
- `version-sort`

<Note>
The `version-sort` strategy is based on the [Rust style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/#sorting).
</Note>

## Linting
### Strict Mode
By default, Tombi operates in `strict` mode. In this mode, objects without `additionalProperties` are treated as if `additionalProperties: false` was specified.
This differs from the standard JSON Schema specification but provides more precise validation by eliminating ambiguity.

To disable strict mode, add `schema.strict = false` to your `tombi.toml` configuration.

### x-tombi-string-formats

In Tombi default behavior, the `format` used in JSON Schema's `“type”: “string"` only recognizes conversions to the following built-in types:

- `date-time`
- `date-time-local`
- `date`
- `time-local`

By adding the `x-tombi-string-formats` key to the root of the JSON Schema, you can add the `format` of the string to the validation target.

```json
{
  "x-tombi-string-formats": [
    "date-time",
    "date-time-local",
    "date",
    "time-local"
  ]
}
```

Currently supported `format` targets are as follows:

| format         | Specification                                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `email`        | [RFC 5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322) |
| `idn-email`    | [RFC 5890](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5890) |
| `hostname`     | [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) |
| `idn-hostname` | [RFC 5890](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5890) |
| `uri`          | [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) |
| `uri-reference`| [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) |
| `uuid`         | [RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122) |

<Note>
If you want to support additional `format` in Tombi, please check if it exists in [JSON Schema Specification](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation#name-defined-formats) or [OpenAPI Format Registry](https://spec.openapis.org/registry/format/).
</Note>

## Language Gap
While TOML and JSON are different languages, JSON Schema remains a valuable tool for representing TOML structures, especially given the abundance of existing schema assets.

Tombi bridges this language gap by using abbreviations to represent JSON Schema concepts that don't have direct equivalents in TOML.

For more details on how Tombi represents these concepts, check out the Hover section.

## JSON Catalog/Schema Cache
Tombi caches JSON Catalog/Schemas in the file system to avoid unnecessary network requests.

### How to Clear Cache
#### CLI
Use `--no-cache` option to disable using caches for a CLI command.

```bash
tombi format --no-cache
```

<Warning>
`--no-cache` option does not use caches, but **saves the latest catalogs/schemas** to the file caches.\
(This behavior is the same as HTTP's `Cache-Control: no-cache`)

It only applies to catalogs/schemas used by the command, and does not update other files.
</Warning>

#### Language Server
Use `RefreshCache` command to clear the cache.

<Warning>
It removes **all file caches** and fetches the latest schema over the network for the editing TOML file.
</Warning>

### Cache Location Search Priority

1. `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tombi`
2. `~/.cache/tombi`

## VSCode Extension
As with [Taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/developing-schemas.html#visual-studio-code-extensions), extensions can associate their own schemas using `tomlValidation`.

You can specify `fileMatch`, which associates the schema with documents whose file matches the given pattern (same as [jsonValidation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.jsonValidation)).

```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "tomlValidation": [
      {
        "fileMatch": "^.*foo.toml$",
        "url": "https://json.schemastore.org/foo.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
