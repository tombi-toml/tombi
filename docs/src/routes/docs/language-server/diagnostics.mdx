# Diagnostics

Real-time error detection and linting feedback in your editor through Tombi's Language Server.

## Workspace Diagnostic
Run diagnostics for the entire workspace.

The editor will use either Push/Pull mode, but to reduce CPU usage from frequent diagnostics,
the execution frequency can be adjusted with throttle-seconds.

```toml
[lsp]
workspace-diagnostic.throttle-seconds = 5
```

<Note>
If you want to run Workspace Diagnostic only once at startup, set `lsp.workspace-diagnostic.throttle-seconds = 0`.

If you want to run Workspace Diagnostic every time, set `lsp.workspace-diagnostic.enabled = false`.
</Note>

<Warning>
When opening the editor in your HOME directory, Workspace Diagnostic will be skipped to avoid scanning a large number of files. 

This is a special exception to prevent performance issues from analyzing too many files and directories.
</Warning>
