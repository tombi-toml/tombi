# Diagnostics

Real-time error detection and linting feedback in your editor through Tombi's Language Server.

## Workspace Diagnostic
Run diagnostics for the entire workspace.

<Note>
If you want to run Workspace Diagnostic every time, set `lsp.workspace-diagnostic.enabled = false`.
</Note>

<Warning>
When opening the editor in your HOME directory, Workspace Diagnostic will be skipped to avoid scanning a large number of files. 

This is a special exception to prevent performance issues from analyzing too many files and directories.
</Warning>
