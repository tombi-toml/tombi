# TOML Versions

## TOML v1.1.0
[TOML v1.1.0](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/releases/tag/1.1.0) has been released, but many tools do not support it yet.
Therefore, the default TOML version is `v1.0.0`.

If you want to use `v1.1.0`, please refer to the next section.

## TOML Version Control

Tombi determines the TOML version for the target file in the following order of priority.

1. The comment directive `#:tombi toml-version = "v1.1.0"` in the TOML document.
2. `toml-version` specified in `[[schemas]]` in the Tombi config.
3. `x-tombi-toml-version` in the root object of JSON Schema.
4. `toml-version` specified in the Tombi config.
5. The default TOML version (Currently `v1.0.0`).
